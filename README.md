## 💡 Design Philosophy

This system was built with these principles:

- **Clarity over complexity** - Simple beats sophisticated if it's easier to use
- **Action-oriented** - Every section drives toward doing, not just planning
- **Scalable foundations** - Built for 50 people but can grow to 500
- **Async-first** - Respects distributed teams and time zones
- **Measurable** - What gets measured gets managed
